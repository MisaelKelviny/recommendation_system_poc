# About this repo
This project is about building a recommendation system. We’ll set up a bookshop where the homepage shows book recommendations based on your recent searches and books you’ve looked at.
Think of this as a basic example of how recommendation algorithms work. They can get pretty complicated, but for now, we’ll keep it simple.
